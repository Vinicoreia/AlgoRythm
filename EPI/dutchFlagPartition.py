# The Dutch Flag Partition is used to kind of teach how a quick sort works
# You're a given a array of 0's, 1's and 2's and a pivot
# Then you must build a function to rearrange this array such that:
# All numbers smaller than the pivot must be to it's left
# All numbers bigger than the pivot must be to it's right

# Suppose the array A = (0,1,2,0,2,1,1) and the pivot index is 3
# this means A[3] is 0 so a valid partitioning would be (0,0,1,2,2,1,1) but (0,0,1,2,1,2,1) is also a valid partition
# if the pivot index is 5 then a valid partition would be (0,0,1,1,1,2,2)


# Write a program that takes an array A and an index i into A and rearranges the elements such that all elements
# less than A[i] appear first, followed by elements equal to A[i], followed by elements greater than A[i].

# There's a better way to do it, with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
# The problem with the dutchFlagTwoPass solution is, for every element it checks if there are smaller ahead
# but we don't need to start from the beginning, we can do this only when the element being checked is less than the pivot
# so in dutchFlagTwoPass using the array (0,1,2,0,1,1) and the pivot index 1
# in the first pass we actually start at 0 and check each index trying to find an element that is smaller than 0, but we shouldn't
# 0 is already smaller than the pivot so we should just go to the next index

# This is an implementation that is O(n) but uses O(1) space
