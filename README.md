# AlgoRythm
Writing main algorithms while listening to music, the commit message is always a song.

## Why?
Music is something we fundamentally admire as humans and i know of no human that does not listen to any song.
So this repo will:

- Serve as a backup of my listened songs troughout my going. 
- Serve also to see what kind of songs makes me write better code, or more code or both.
- `NOT` be a representation of all songs i heard while coding but just a sample. 

### Change Of Plans
Since this was starting to getting really confusing, for me mostly, I decided to reestructure and open new repositories here. I will open one for EPI that will serve me as a way to relearn Python and review my data structures and another one only for DS in javascript. Maybe later I start one about Design Patterns in one of those two main focused languages.

 
### Bibliography
 - I'll use Cormen's famous Introduction to Algorithms book when coding.
 - I'm also using Skiena's The Algorithm Design Manual.
 - I'm using leetCode to practice coding.
