# AlgoRythm
Writting main algorithms while listening to music, the commit message is always a song.

## Why?
This may sound retarded, and it is, but music is something we fundamentally admire as humans and i know of no human that does not listen to any song.
So this repo will:

- Serve as a backup of my listened songs troughout my going. 
- Serve also to see what kind of songs makes me write better code, or more code or both.
- `NOT` be a representation of all songs i heard while coding but just a sample. 
 
### Bibliography
 - I'll use Cormen's famous Introduction to Algorithms book when coding.
